I want to create a book management system. Which have AUTH super-admin, admin, and user roles. 
Super admin has all the access to create, delete, update, and read the books of all admins. 
I want multiple admins but only one super admin.
Every admin creates books and operates on them only which one it created.
Super-admin also creates the book and can assign it to any admin in the future. 
After that, Users can see all the books and place orders. 
I want to design the MongoDB schema for this task. Give me the most optimized schema.
